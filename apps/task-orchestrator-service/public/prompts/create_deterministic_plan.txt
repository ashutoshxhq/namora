User Query: {{query}}

Identified Actions: 
```
{{identified_actions}}
```

Plan: 
```
{{plan}}
```

Your task is to filter and arrange the `Identified Actions` to create a deterministic plan based on the query requirements and the plan(its only a guideline to pick right action from `Identified Actions`) so that the user's query can be achieved.
Rules to create an action execution plan:
1. The action execution plan should be a key value pair of number to action_id.
2. The action_id should be the id of the action in the `Identified Actions` list.
3. The action execution plan should be in the order of execution.
4. The action execution plan should select absolute minimum number of actions to achieve the query.
5. If there are multiple ways to achieve the query, the action execution plan should select the one with minimum number of actions.
6. If removing an action from the action execution plan does not affect the query, then the action should be removed from the action execution plan.
